# Energy Storage Optimisation ASP

Energy storage optimisation using Answer Set Programming.

## Introduction

With electricity quickly replacing other power sources for applications such as climate control and electric vehicles, more and more buildings are equiped with photovoltaic solar panels and batteries for energy storage. This, in combination with limits on electricity grids and the advent of dynamic energy pricing contracts, provides an opportunity for optimising the strategical charging and discharging of batteries. By charging when electricity is cheap, and discharging when expensive, both financial gain and lower reliance of limited electrical grids can be achieved.

This project aims to generate optimal storage schedules using Answer Set Programming (ASP).

## Dataset

This repository contains a novel dataset for energy storage optimisation. This dataset provides a broad range of situations an optimal solution should be able to handle. It is described in detail in [Dataset.md](Dataset.md).
